# Data Policy Manager (B2Safe-DPM)
This package contains the code for the data policy manager. The DPM consists of
a web interface for creating and managing the policies. The policies are defined
in an abstract language. Client scripts exist that allow users to download the
policies and transform them into executable workflows.

You can find information on installing the web interface in the web/README.md 
file. The client/README.md contains information on the client application.
The package wiki (https://github.com/EUDAT-B2SAFE/B2SAFE-DPM/wiki) contains 
information on using the web interface and the client.
