# Data Policy Manager (B2Save-DPM)
This package contains the code for the data policy manager. The DPM consists of
a web interface for creating and managing the policies. The policies are defined
in an abstract language. Client scripts exist that allow users to download the
policies and transform them into executable workflows.

The code for the web interface is under the 'web' directory (please see the
  README there). The client scripts under the 'client' directory provide examples
  of how to use the policies.
